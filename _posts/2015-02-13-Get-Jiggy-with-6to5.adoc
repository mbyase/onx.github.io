= Get Jiggy with 6to5
:hp-tags: 6to5, JavaScript, ECMAScript

I recently went to get my hands dirty with https://6to5.org/[6to5]. So far, I like it a lot! I don't know wether it's writing ECMAScript 6 or because of the process.

It's stupid simple to setup and get started with. I tend to use https://gulp.io[Gulp] to automate my process, which makes life so much easier. But you can use whatever method you'd like.

[source,js]
----
var gulp = require('gulp');
var to5 = require('gulp-6to5');

gulp.task('to5', function() {
	return gulp.src('src/**/*.js')
        .pipe(to5)
    	.pipe(dest('dist'));
});
----

And then just run it like so:

[source,bash]
$ gulp to5

Pretty awesome huh.
